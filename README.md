# í·  Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a variety of machine learning techniques implemented in Python. Each script focuses on a different algorithm or concept, written for clarity and experimentation.

## í³š Techniques Covered

- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- And more to come...
